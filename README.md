# sqlalchemy-challenge
 Please find the climate analysis in "climate_starter.ipynb." Part 2 of the assignment can be found in "app.py." All files used for resources are in the "Resources" folder.

 Please note for the API assignment that I changed the last two names of url from <start> and <start>/<end> to start and start/end, respectively. This is because this symbol: <> causes a line break in the url, and should not be used to denote a name. I confirmed this with one of the TA's and he said that this naming should still be accepted for the assignment.

 Thanks!
